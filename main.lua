    Based on code from lecture 1 of CS50G written by:
        Author: Colton Ogden
        cogden@cs50.harvard.edu

    An endless scrolling game where the player controls the cat, "Onion", using either the arrow keys to move in the corresponding direction, or the W-A-S-D keys for up-left-down-right movement. The objective of the game is to survive against five "ghosts" for as long as possible. The scoring mechanism awards the player 1 point for every 3 seconds that they survive.

    Note: The soundtrack is a snippet+loop of an instrumental version of
     "Get Got" by Death Grips. I don't have any license to use this music,
     but I am NOT using this in any commercial sense whatsoever. I only wrote
     this game as an experiment for myself to better understand Game Development
     while going through CS50's Game Development course on edX.
     If you intend to use this code, PLEASE change the soundtrack to something you have
     a license to use, or some other royalty-free music. I just really loved how this song
     worked with the game, and of course, I love Death Grips.
